Building ghit (Ghamza git - ghit :D) in Rust. Indeed not a step-by-step tutorial, just following [Bulding git book](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/) but switched to Rust instead of Ruby and having a different architecture.

## The Architecture

I made a cargo workspace. Each member of the workspace has its responsibility. I've created a `ghit_core` library, which, as the name stands, is a core library that should be reusable by other apps or libsâ€”and created `ghit_cli`, which parses the CLI arguments and passes them to the `core`. This approach should be extensible; for the future, we may add `ghit_gui` that displays some nice diffs and buttons to make `ghit` operations.

## Setup

I've set up a rust workspace by creating a directory and creating a rust `lib` and a `bin` and adding them as members.

```bash
mkdir ghit
cd ghit
cargo new --lib ghit_core --vcs none
cargo new --bin ghit_cli --vcs none
touch Cargo.toml
```

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["ghit_cli", "ghit_core"]
```

And then make `ghit_cli` depends on `ghit_core`.

```toml
[package]
name = "ghit_cli"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
ghit_core = { version = "*", path = "../ghit_core" }
```

For libraries, I use `thiserror` for error propagation, and for binaries, I use `anyhow`. They're famous in the Rust ecosystem.

```bash
cargo add -p ghit_core thiserror
cargo add -p ghit_cli anyhow
```

I've set up the error struct in the lib.

```rust
/* error.rs */
#[derive(thiserror::Error, Debug)]
pub enum GhitError {}
```

```rust
/* prelude.rs */
pub use crate::error::GhitError;

pub type GhitResult<T> = core::result::Result<T, GhitError>;
```

And now I was good to go to start with the first `ghit` command, the `init`.
