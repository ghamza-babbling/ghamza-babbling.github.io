In 2020, Github renamed the default branch from `master` to `main` because of "Cultural sensitivity." People became way too sensitive and easily triggered. Well, the master-slave model will still be alive in the history of computer science—for example, the well-known master-slave network topology. I'm not against either the naming or the slave-free world. I like `main` better. Concurrency uses the `main` thread term. Thread's spawn and join are similar to git's branch and merge. So `main` feels better. But what bothers me is being sensitive to such naming. If people and companies are keen on slavery, ask your government to stop milking Africa and treat their people like Islam did.

The Linux kernel (the most significant software project humanity has done so far) uses `master`. Try changing that!

There is a saying by Linus Torvalds. I can't find the exact words to it, but it means that some companies talk about the direction of political correctness to the extent of not being about software anymore.

If I can rename the default branch, it will name it `senpai`.
